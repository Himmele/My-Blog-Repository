<H2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center>Flowchart (Executional Steps) of 
Genetic Programming</H2>
<P>Genetic programming is problem-independent in the sense that the flowchart 
specifying the basic sequence of executional steps is not modified for each new 
run or each new problem. </P>
<P>There is usually no discretionary human intervention or interaction during a 
run of genetic programming (although a human user may exercise judgment as to 
whether to terminate a run). </P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The figure below is a flowchart showing the executional steps 
of a run of genetic programming. The flowchart shows the genetic operations of 
crossover, reproduction, and mutation as well as the architecture-altering 
operations. This flowchart shows a two-offspring version of the crossover 
operation. </P>

height=508 src="Flowchart-Dateien/BBB2028flowchartleft.gif" width=500></P>
<H3>Overview of Flowchart</H3>
<P>Genetic programming starts with an initial population of computer programs 
composed of functions and terminals appropriate to the problem. The individual 
programs in the initial population are typically generated by recursively 
generating a rooted point-labeled program tree composed of random choices of the 
primitive functions and terminals (provided by the human user as part of the 
first and second <B><A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/gppreparatory.html">preparatory 
steps</A></B> of a run of genetic programming). The initial individuals are 
usually generated subject to a pre-established maximum size (specified by the 
user as a minor parameter as part of the fourth preparatory step). In general, 
the programs in the population are of different size (number of functions and 
terminals) and of different shape (the particular graphical arrangement of 
functions and terminals in the program tree). </P>
<P>Each individual program in the population is executed. Then, each individual 
program in the population is either measured or compared in terms of how well it 
performs the task at hand (using the fitness measure provided in the third 
preparatory step). For many problems (including all problems in this book), this 
measurement yields a single explicit numerical value, called <I>fitness</I>. The 
fitness of a program may be measured in many different ways, including, for 
example, in terms of the amount of error between its output and the desired 
output, the amount of time (fuel, money, etc.) required to bring a system to a 
desired target state, the accuracy of the program in recognizing patterns or 
classifying objects into classes, the payoff that a game-playing program 
produces, or the compliance of a complex structure (such as an antenna, circuit, 
or controller) with user-specified design criteria. The execution of the program 
sometimes returns one or more explicit values. Alternatively, the execution of a 
program may consist only of side effects on the state of a world (e.g., a 
robot’s actions). Alternatively, the execution of a program may produce both 
return values and side effects. </P>
<P>The fitness measure is, for many practical problems, multiobjective in the 
sense that it combines two or more different elements. The different elements of 
the fitness measure are often in competition with one another to some degree. 
</P>
<P>For many problems, each program in the population is executed over a 
representative sample of different <I>fitness cases</I>. These fitness cases may 
represent different values of the program’s input(s), different initial 
conditions of a system, or different environments. Sometimes the fitness cases 
are constructed probabilistically. </P>
<P>The creation of the initial random population is, in effect, a blind random 
search of the search space of the problem. It provides a baseline for judging 
future search efforts. Typically, the individual programs in generation 0 all 
have exceedingly poor fitness. Nonetheless, some individuals in the population 
are (usually) more fit than others. The differences in fitness are then 
exploited by genetic programming. Genetic programming applies Darwinian 
selection and the genetic operations to create a new population of offspring 
programs from the current population. </P>
<P>The genetic operations include crossover (sexual recombination), mutation, 
reproduction, and the architecture-altering operations. These genetic operations 
are applied to individual(s) that are probabilistically selected from the 
population based on fitness. In this probabilistic selection process, better 
individuals are favored over inferior individuals. However, the best individual 
in the population is not necessarily selected and the worst individual in the 
population is not necessarily passed over. </P>
<P>After the genetic operations are performed on the current population, the 
population of offspring (i.e., the new generation) replaces the current 
population (i.e., the now-old generation). This iterative process of measuring 
fitness and performing the genetic operations is repeated over many generations. 
</P>
<P>The run of genetic programming terminates when the termination criterion (as 
provided by the fifth preparatory step) is satisfied. The outcome of the run is 
specified by the method of result designation. The best individual ever 
encountered during the run (i.e., the best-so-far individual) is typically 
designated as the result of the run. </P>
<P>All programs in the initial random population (generation 0) of a run of 
genetic programming are syntactically valid, executable programs. The genetic 
operations that are performed during the run (i.e., crossover, mutation, 
reproduction, and the architecture-altering operations) are designed to produce 
offspring that are syntactically valid, executable programs. Thus, every 
individual created during a run of genetic programming (including, in 
particular, the best-of-run individual) is a syntactically valid, executable 
program.</P>
<P>There are numerous alternative implementations of genetic programming that 
vary from the foregoing brief description. </P>
<H3>Creation of Initial Population of Computer Programs</H3>
<P>Genetic programming starts with a primordial ooze of thousands of 
randomly-generated computer programs. The set of functions that may appear at 
the internal points of a program tree may include ordinary arithmetic functions 
and conditional operators. The set of terminals appearing at the external points 
typically include the program's external inputs (such as the independent 
variables X and Y) and random constants (such as 3.2 and 0.4). The randomly 
created programs typically have different sizes and shapes. <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/creation.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of random creation of two illustrative computer 
programs</B></A>. </P>
<H3>Main Generational Loop of Genetic Programming</H3>
<P>The main generational loop of a run of genetic programming consists of the 
fitness evaluation, Darwinian selection, and the genetic operations. Each 
individual program in the population is evaluated to determine how fit it is at 
solving the problem at hand. Programs are then probabilistically selected from 
the population based on their fitness to participate in the various genetic 
operations, with reselection allowed. While a more fit program has a better 
chance of being selected, even individuals known to be unfit are allocated some 
trials in a mathematically principled way. That is, genetic programming is not a 
purely greedy hill-climbing algorithm. </P>
<P>The individuals in the initial random population and the offspring produced 
by each genetic operation are all syntactically valid executable programs. </P>
<P>After many generations, a program may emerge that solves, or approximately 
solves, the problem at hand. </P>
<H4>Mutation Operation</H4>
<P>In the mutation operation, a single parental program is probabilistically 
selected from the population based on fitness. A mutation point is randomly 
chosen, the subtree rooted at that point is deleted, and a new subtree is grown 
there using the same random growth process that was used to generate the initial 
population. This asexual mutation operation is typically performed sparingly 
(with a low probability of, say, 1% during each generation of the run). <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/mutation.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of mutation operation</B></A>. </P>
<H4>Crossover (Sexual Recombination) Operation</H4>
<P>In the crossover, or sexual recombination operation, two parental programs 
are probabilistically selected from the population based on fitness. The two 
parents participating in crossover are usually of different sizes and shapes. A 
crossover point is randomly chosen in the first parent and a crossover point is 
randomly chosen in the second parent. Then the subtree rooted at the crossover 
point of the first, or receiving, parent is deleted and replaced by the subtree 
from the second, or contributing, parent. Crossover is the predominant operation 
in genetic programming (and genetic algorithm) work and is performed with a high 
probability (say, 85% to 90%). <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/crossover.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of crossover operation</B></A>. </P>
<H4>Reproduction Operation</H4>
<P>The reproduction operation copies a single individual, probabilistically 
selected based on fitness, into the next generation of the population. </P>
<H4>Architecture-Altering Operations</H4>
<P>Simple computer programs consist of one main program (called a 
result-producing branch). However, more complicated programs contain subroutines 
(also called automatically defined functions, ADFs, or function-defining 
branches), iterations (automatically defined iterations or ADIs), loops 
(automatically defined loops or ADLs), recursions (automatically defined 
recursions or ADRs), and memory of various dimensionality and size 
(automatically defined stores or ADSs). If a human user is trying to solve an 
engineering problem, he or she might choose to simply prespecify a reasonable 
fixed architectural arrangement for all programs in the population (i.e., the 
number and types of branches and number of arguments that each branch 
possesses). Genetic programming can then be used to evolve the exact sequence of 
primitive work-performing steps in each branch. </P>
<P>However, sometimes the size and shape of the solution <I>is</I> the problem 
(or at least a major part of it). Genetic programming is capable of making all 
architectural decisions dynamically during the run of genetic programming. 
Genetic programming uses architecture-altering operations to automatically 
determine program architecture in a manner that parallels gene duplication in 
nature and the related operation of gene deletion in nature. 
Architecture-altering operations provide a way, dynamically during the run of 
genetic programming, to add and delete subroutines and other types of branches 
to individual programs to add and delete arguments possessed by the subroutines 
and other types of branches. These architecture-altering operation quickly 
create an architecturally diverse population containing programs with different 
numbers of subroutines, arguments, iterations, loops, recursions, and memory 
and, also, different hierarchical arrangements of these elements. Programs with 
architectures that are well-suited to the problem at hand will tend to grow and 
prosper in the competitive evolutionary process, while programs with inadequate 
architectures will tend to wither away under the relentless selective pressure 
of the problem's fitness measure. Thus, the architecture-altering operations 
relieve the human user of the task of prespecifying program architecture. </P>
<P>There are several different architecture-altering operations (described 
below). They are each applied sparingly during the run (say, with a probability 
of 1/2% of 1% on each generation). </P>
<P>The subroutine duplication operation duplicates a preexisting subroutine in 
an individual program gives a new name to the copy and randomly divides the 
preexisting calls to the old subroutine between the two. This operation changes 
the program architecture by broadening the hierarchy of subroutines in the 
overall program. As with gene duplication in nature, this operation preserves 
semantics when it first occurs. The two subroutines typically diverge later, 
sometimes yielding specialization. <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/branch-dup2.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of the subroutine duplication operation</B></A><B>.</B> </P>
<P>The argument duplication operation duplicates one argument of a subroutine, 
randomly divides internal references to it, and preserves overall program 
semantics by adjusting all calls to the subroutine. This operation enlarges the 
dimensionality of the subspace on which the subroutine operates. <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/arg-dup2.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of the argument duplication operation</B></A>. </P>
<P>The subroutine creation operation can create a new subroutine from part of a 
main result-producing branch thereby deepening the hierarchy of references in 
the overall program, by creating a hierarchical reference between the main 
program and the new subroutine. The subroutine creation operation can also 
create a new subroutine from part of an existing subroutine further deepening 
the hierarchy of references, by creating a hierarchical reference between a 
preexisting subroutine and a new subroutine and a deeper and more complex 
overall hierarchy. <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/branch-create2.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of the subroutine creation operation</B></A><B>.</B> </P>
<P>The architecture-altering operation of subroutine deletion deletes a 
subroutine from a program thereby making the hierarchy of subroutines either 
narrower or shallower. <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/branch-delete.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of the subroutine deletion operation</B></A><B>.</B> </P>
<P>The argument deletion operation deletes an argument from a subroutine thereby 
reducing the amount of information available to the subroutine, a process that 
can be viewed as generalization. <A 
href="http://www.genetic-programming.com/arg-delete.gif"><B>Click here for 
animated example of the argument deletion operation</B></A>. </P>
<P>Other architecture-altering operations add and delete automatically defined 
iterations, automatically defined loops, automatically defined recursions, and 
automatically defined stores (memory). </P>
