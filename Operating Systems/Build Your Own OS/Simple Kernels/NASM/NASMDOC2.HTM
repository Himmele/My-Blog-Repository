<h2><a name="chapter-2">Chapter 2: Running NASM</a></h2>
<h3><a name="section-2.1">2.1 NASM Command-Line Syntax</a></h3>
<p>To assemble a file, you issue a command of the form
<p><pre>
nasm -f &lt;format&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [-o &lt;output&gt;]
</pre>
<p>For example,
<p><pre>
nasm -f elf myfile.asm
</pre>
<p>will assemble <code><nobr>myfile.asm</nobr></code> into an ELF object
file <code><nobr>myfile.o</nobr></code>. And
<p><pre>
nasm -f bin myfile.asm -o myfile.com
</pre>
<p>will assemble <code><nobr>myfile.asm</nobr></code> into a raw binary
file <code><nobr>myfile.com</nobr></code>.
<p>To produce a listing file, with the hex codes output from NASM displayed
on the left of the original sources, use the <code><nobr>-l</nobr></code>
option to give a listing file name, for example:
<p><pre>
nasm -f coff myfile.asm -l myfile.lst
</pre>
<p>To get further usage instructions from NASM, try typing
<p><pre>
nasm -h
</pre>
<p>This will also list the available output file formats, and what they
are.
<p>If you use Linux but aren't sure whether your system is
<code><nobr>a.out</nobr></code> or ELF, type
<p><pre>
file nasm
</pre>
<p>(in the directory in which you put the NASM binary when you installed
it). If it says something like
<p><pre>
nasm: ELF 32-bit LSB executable i386 (386 and up) Version 1
</pre>
<p>then your system is ELF, and you should use the option
<code><nobr>-f elf</nobr></code> when you want NASM to produce Linux object
files. If it says
<p><pre>
nasm: Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (QMAGIC)
</pre>
<p>or something similar, your system is <code><nobr>a.out</nobr></code>,
and you should use <code><nobr>-f aout</nobr></code> instead (Linux
<code><nobr>a.out</nobr></code> systems are considered obsolete, and are
rare these days.)
<p>Like Unix compilers and assemblers, NASM is silent unless it goes wrong:
you won't see any output at all, unless it gives error messages.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.1">2.1.1 The <code><nobr>-o</nobr></code> Option: Specifying the Output File Name</a></h4>
<p>NASM will normally choose the name of your output file for you;
precisely how it does this is dependent on the object file format. For
Microsoft object file formats (<code><nobr>obj</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>win32</nobr></code>), it will remove the
<code><nobr>.asm</nobr></code> extension (or whatever extension you like to
use - NASM doesn't care) from your source file name and substitute
<code><nobr>.obj</nobr></code>. For Unix object file formats
(<code><nobr>aout</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>coff</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>elf</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>as86</nobr></code>) it will
substitute <code><nobr>.o</nobr></code>. For <code><nobr>rdf</nobr></code>,
it will use <code><nobr>.rdf</nobr></code>, and for the
<code><nobr>bin</nobr></code> format it will simply remove the extension,
so that <code><nobr>myfile.asm</nobr></code> produces the output file
<code><nobr>myfile</nobr></code>.
<p>If the output file already exists, NASM will overwrite it, unless it has
the same name as the input file, in which case it will give a warning and
use <code><nobr>nasm.out</nobr></code> as the output file name instead.
<p>For situations in which this behaviour is unacceptable, NASM provides
the <code><nobr>-o</nobr></code> command-line option, which allows you to
specify your desired output file name. You invoke
<code><nobr>-o</nobr></code> by following it with the name you wish for the
output file, either with or without an intervening space. For example:
<p><pre>
nasm -f bin program.asm -o program.com 
nasm -f bin driver.asm -odriver.sys
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-2.1.2">2.1.2 The <code><nobr>-f</nobr></code> Option: Specifying the Output File Format</a></h4>
<p>If you do not supply the <code><nobr>-f</nobr></code> option to NASM, it
will choose an output file format for you itself. In the distribution
versions of NASM, the default is always <code><nobr>bin</nobr></code>; if
you've compiled your own copy of NASM, you can redefine
<code><nobr>OF_DEFAULT</nobr></code> at compile time and choose what you
want the default to be.
<p>Like <code><nobr>-o</nobr></code>, the intervening space between
<code><nobr>-f</nobr></code> and the output file format is optional; so
<code><nobr>-f elf</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>-felf</nobr></code> are
both valid.
<p>A complete list of the available output file formats can be given by
issuing the command <code><nobr>nasm -h</nobr></code>.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.3">2.1.3 The <code><nobr>-l</nobr></code> Option: Generating a Listing File</a></h4>
<p>If you supply the <code><nobr>-l</nobr></code> option to NASM, followed
(with the usual optional space) by a file name, NASM will generate a
source-listing file for you, in which addresses and generated code are
listed on the left, and the actual source code, with expansions of
multi-line macros (except those which specifically request no expansion in
source listings: see <a href="nasmdoc4.htm#section-4.2.9">section
4.2.9</a>) on the right. For example:
<p><pre>
nasm -f elf myfile.asm -l myfile.lst
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-2.1.4">2.1.4 The <code><nobr>-E</nobr></code> Option: Send Errors to a File</a></h4>
<p>Under MS-DOS it can be difficult (though there are ways) to redirect the
standard-error output of a program to a file. Since NASM usually produces
its warning and error messages on <code><nobr>stderr</nobr></code>, this
can make it hard to capture the errors if (for example) you want to load
them into an editor.
<p>NASM therefore provides the <code><nobr>-E</nobr></code> option, taking
a filename argument which causes errors to be sent to the specified files
rather than standard error. Therefore you can redirect the errors into a
file by typing
<p><pre>
nasm -E myfile.err -f obj myfile.asm
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-2.1.5">2.1.5 The <code><nobr>-s</nobr></code> Option: Send Errors to <code><nobr>stdout</nobr></code></a></h4>
<p>The <code><nobr>-s</nobr></code> option redirects error messages to
<code><nobr>stdout</nobr></code> rather than
<code><nobr>stderr</nobr></code>, so it can be redirected under MS-DOS. To
assemble the file <code><nobr>myfile.asm</nobr></code> and pipe its output
to the <code><nobr>more</nobr></code> program, you can type:
<p><pre>
nasm -s -f obj myfile.asm | more
</pre>
<p>See also the <code><nobr>-E</nobr></code> option,
<a href="#section-2.1.4">section 2.1.4</a>.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.6">2.1.6 The <code><nobr>-i</nobr></code> Option: Include File Search Directories</a></h4>
<p>When NASM sees the <code><nobr>%include</nobr></code> directive in a
source file (see <a href="nasmdoc4.htm#section-4.5">section 4.5</a>), it
will search for the given file not only in the current directory, but also
in any directories specified on the command line by the use of the
<code><nobr>-i</nobr></code> option. Therefore you can include files from a
macro library, for example, by typing
<p><pre>
nasm -ic:\macrolib\ -f obj myfile.asm
</pre>
<p>(As usual, a space between <code><nobr>-i</nobr></code> and the path
name is allowed, and optional).
<p>NASM, in the interests of complete source-code portability, does not
understand the file naming conventions of the OS it is running on; the
string you provide as an argument to the <code><nobr>-i</nobr></code>
option will be prepended exactly as written to the name of the include
file. Therefore the trailing backslash in the above example is necessary.
Under Unix, a trailing forward slash is similarly necessary.
<p>(You can use this to your advantage, if you're really perverse, by
noting that the option <code><nobr>-ifoo</nobr></code> will cause
<code><nobr>%include "bar.i"</nobr></code> to search for the file
<code><nobr>foobar.i</nobr></code>...)
<p>If you want to define a <em>standard</em> include search path, similar
to <code><nobr>/usr/include</nobr></code> on Unix systems, you should place
one or more <code><nobr>-i</nobr></code> directives in the
<code><nobr>NASM</nobr></code> environment variable (see
<a href="#section-2.1.13">section 2.1.13</a>).
<p>For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can also
be specified as <code><nobr>-I</nobr></code>.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.7">2.1.7 The <code><nobr>-p</nobr></code> Option: Pre-Include a File</a></h4>
<p>NASM allows you to specify files to be <em>pre-included</em> into your
source file, by the use of the <code><nobr>-p</nobr></code> option. So
running
<p><pre>
nasm myfile.asm -p myinc.inc
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to running <code><nobr>nasm myfile.asm</nobr></code> and
placing the directive <code><nobr>%include "myinc.inc"</nobr></code> at the
start of the file.
<p>For consistency with the <code><nobr>-I</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>-D</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>-U</nobr></code> options, this
option can also be specified as <code><nobr>-P</nobr></code>.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.8">2.1.8 The <code><nobr>-d</nobr></code> Option:  Pre-Define a Macro</a></h4>
<p>Just as the <code><nobr>-p</nobr></code> option gives an alternative to
placing <code><nobr>%include</nobr></code> directives at the start of a
source file, the <code><nobr>-d</nobr></code> option gives an alternative
to placing a <code><nobr>%define</nobr></code> directive. You could code
<p><pre>
nasm myfile.asm -dFOO=100
</pre>
<p>as an alternative to placing the directive
<p><pre>
%define FOO 100
</pre>
<p>at the start of the file. You can miss off the macro value, as well: the
option <code><nobr>-dFOO</nobr></code> is equivalent to coding
<code><nobr>%define FOO</nobr></code>. This form of the directive may be
useful for selecting assembly-time options which are then tested using
<code><nobr>%ifdef</nobr></code>, for example
<code><nobr>-dDEBUG</nobr></code>.
<p>For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can also
be specified as <code><nobr>-D</nobr></code>.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.9">2.1.9 The <code><nobr>-u</nobr></code> Option:  Undefine a Macro</a></h4>
<p>The <code><nobr>-u</nobr></code> option undefines a macro that would
otherwise have been pre-defined, either automatically or by a
<code><nobr>-p</nobr></code> or <code><nobr>-d</nobr></code> option
specified earlier on the command lines.
<p>For example, the following command line:
<p><pre>
nasm myfile.asm -dFOO=100 -uFOO
</pre>
<p>would result in <code><nobr>FOO</nobr></code> <em>not</em> being a
predefined macro in the program. This is useful to override options
specified at a different point in a Makefile.
<p>For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can also
be specified as <code><nobr>-U</nobr></code>.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.10">2.1.10 The <code><nobr>-e</nobr></code> Option: Preprocess Only</a></h4>
<p>NASM allows the preprocessor to be run on its own, up to a point. Using
the <code><nobr>-e</nobr></code> option (which requires no arguments) will
cause NASM to preprocess its input file, expand all the macro references,
remove all the comments and preprocessor directives, and print the
resulting file on standard output (or save it to a file, if the
<code><nobr>-o</nobr></code> option is also used).
<p>This option cannot be applied to programs which require the preprocessor
to evaluate expressions which depend on the values of symbols: so code such
as
<p><pre>
%assign tablesize ($-tablestart)
</pre>
<p>will cause an error in preprocess-only mode.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.11">2.1.11 The <code><nobr>-a</nobr></code> Option: Don't Preprocess At All</a></h4>
<p>If NASM is being used as the back end to a compiler, it might be
desirable to suppress preprocessing completely and assume the compiler has
already done it, to save time and increase compilation speeds. The
<code><nobr>-a</nobr></code> option, requiring no argument, instructs NASM
to replace its powerful preprocessor with a stub preprocessor which does
nothing.
<h4><a name="section-2.1.12">2.1.12 The <code><nobr>-w</nobr></code> Option: Enable or Disable Assembly Warnings</a></h4>
<p>NASM can observe many conditions during the course of assembly which are
worth mentioning to the user, but not a sufficiently severe error to
justify NASM refusing to generate an output file. These conditions are
reported like errors, but come up with the word `warning' before the
message. Warnings do not prevent NASM from generating an output file and
returning a success status to the operating system.
<p>Some conditions are even less severe than that: they are only sometimes
worth mentioning to the user. Therefore NASM supports the
<code><nobr>-w</nobr></code> command-line option, which enables or disables
certain classes of assembly warning. Such warning classes are described by
a name, for example <code><nobr>orphan-labels</nobr></code>; you can enable
warnings of this class by the command-line option
<code><nobr>-w+orphan-labels</nobr></code> and disable it by
<code><nobr>-w-orphan-labels</nobr></code>.
<p>The suppressible warning classes are:
<ul>
<li><code><nobr>macro-params</nobr></code> covers warnings about multi-line
macros being invoked with the wrong number of parameters. This warning
class is enabled by default; see
<a href="nasmdoc4.htm#section-4.2.1">section 4.2.1</a> for an example of
why you might want to disable it.
<li><code><nobr>orphan-labels</nobr></code> covers warnings about source
lines which contain no instruction but define a label without a trailing
colon. NASM does not warn about this somewhat obscure condition by default;
see <a href="nasmdoc3.htm#section-3.1">section 3.1</a> for an example of
why you might want it to.
<li><code><nobr>number-overflow</nobr></code> covers warnings about numeric
constants which don't fit in 32 bits (for example, it's easy to type one
too many Fs and produce <code><nobr>0x7ffffffff</nobr></code> by mistake).
This warning class is enabled by default.
</ul>
<h4><a name="section-2.1.13">2.1.13 The <code><nobr>NASM</nobr></code> Environment Variable</a></h4>
<p>If you define an environment variable called
<code><nobr>NASM</nobr></code>, the program will interpret it as a list of
extra command-line options, which are processed before the real command
line. You can use this to define standard search directories for include
files, by putting <code><nobr>-i</nobr></code> options in the
<code><nobr>NASM</nobr></code> variable.
<p>The value of the variable is split up at white space, so that the value
<code><nobr>-s -ic:\nasmlib</nobr></code> will be treated as two separate
options. However, that means that the value
<code><nobr>-dNAME="my name"</nobr></code> won't do what you might want,
because it will be split at the space and the NASM command-line processing
will get confused by the two nonsensical words
<code><nobr>-dNAME="my</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>name"</nobr></code>.
<p>To get round this, NASM provides a feature whereby, if you begin the
<code><nobr>NASM</nobr></code> environment variable with some character
that isn't a minus sign, then NASM will treat this character as the
separator character for options. So setting the
<code><nobr>NASM</nobr></code> variable to the value
<code><nobr>!-s!-ic:\nasmlib</nobr></code> is equivalent to setting it to
<code><nobr>-s -ic:\nasmlib</nobr></code>, but
<code><nobr>!-dNAME="my name"</nobr></code> will work.
<h3><a name="section-2.2">2.2 Quick Start for MASM Users</a></h3>
<p>If you're used to writing programs with MASM, or with TASM in
MASM-compatible (non-Ideal) mode, or with <code><nobr>a86</nobr></code>,
this section attempts to outline the major differences between MASM's
syntax and NASM's. If you're not already used to MASM, it's probably worth
skipping this section.
<h4><a name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1 NASM Is Case-Sensitive</a></h4>
<p>One simple difference is that NASM is case-sensitive. It makes a
difference whether you call your label <code><nobr>foo</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>Foo</nobr></code> or <code><nobr>FOO</nobr></code>. If you're
assembling to DOS or OS/2 <code><nobr>.OBJ</nobr></code> files, you can
invoke the <code><nobr>UPPERCASE</nobr></code> directive (documented in
<a href="nasmdoc6.htm#section-6.2">section 6.2</a>) to ensure that all
symbols exported to other code modules are forced to be upper case; but
even then, <em>within</em> a single module, NASM will distinguish between
labels differing only in case.
<h4><a name="section-2.2.2">2.2.2 NASM Requires Square Brackets For Memory References</a></h4>
<p>NASM was designed with simplicity of syntax in mind. One of the design
goals of NASM is that it should be possible, as far as is practical, for
the user to look at a single line of NASM code and tell what opcode is
generated by it. You can't do this in MASM: if you declare, for example,
<p><pre>
foo       equ 1 
bar       dw 2
</pre>
<p>then the two lines of code
<p><pre>
          mov ax,foo 
          mov ax,bar
</pre>
<p>generate completely different opcodes, despite having identical-looking
syntaxes.
<p>NASM avoids this undesirable situation by having a much simpler syntax
for memory references. The rule is simply that any access to the
<em>contents</em> of a memory location requires square brackets around the
address, and any access to the <em>address</em> of a variable doesn't. So
an instruction of the form <code><nobr>mov ax,foo</nobr></code> will
<em>always</em> refer to a compile-time constant, whether it's an
<code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> or the address of a variable; and to access
the <em>contents</em> of the variable <code><nobr>bar</nobr></code>, you
must code <code><nobr>mov ax,[bar]</nobr></code>.
<p>This also means that NASM has no need for MASM's
<code><nobr>OFFSET</nobr></code> keyword, since the MASM code
<code><nobr>mov ax,offset bar</nobr></code> means exactly the same thing as
NASM's <code><nobr>mov ax,bar</nobr></code>. If you're trying to get large
amounts of MASM code to assemble sensibly under NASM, you can always code
<code><nobr>%idefine offset</nobr></code> to make the preprocessor treat
the <code><nobr>OFFSET</nobr></code> keyword as a no-op.
<p>This issue is even more confusing in <code><nobr>a86</nobr></code>,
where declaring a label with a trailing colon defines it to be a `label' as
opposed to a `variable' and causes <code><nobr>a86</nobr></code> to adopt
NASM-style semantics; so in <code><nobr>a86</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>mov ax,var</nobr></code> has different behaviour depending on
whether <code><nobr>var</nobr></code> was declared as
<code><nobr>var: dw 0</nobr></code> (a label) or
<code><nobr>var dw 0</nobr></code> (a word-size variable). NASM is very
simple by comparison: <em>everything</em> is a label.
<p>NASM, in the interests of simplicity, also does not support the hybrid
syntaxes supported by MASM and its clones, such as
<code><nobr>mov ax,table[bx]</nobr></code>, where a memory reference is
denoted by one portion outside square brackets and another portion inside.
The correct syntax for the above is
<code><nobr>mov ax,[table+bx]</nobr></code>. Likewise,
<code><nobr>mov ax,es:[di]</nobr></code> is wrong and
<code><nobr>mov ax,[es:di]</nobr></code> is right.
<h4><a name="section-2.2.3">2.2.3 NASM Doesn't Store Variable Types</a></h4>
<p>NASM, by design, chooses not to remember the types of variables you
declare. Whereas MASM will remember, on seeing
<code><nobr>var dw 0</nobr></code>, that you declared
<code><nobr>var</nobr></code> as a word-size variable, and will then be
able to fill in the ambiguity in the size of the instruction
<code><nobr>mov var,2</nobr></code>, NASM will deliberately remember
nothing about the symbol <code><nobr>var</nobr></code> except where it
begins, and so you must explicitly code
<code><nobr>mov word [var],2</nobr></code>.
<p>For this reason, NASM doesn't support the
<code><nobr>LODS</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>MOVS</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>STOS</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>SCAS</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>CMPS</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>INS</nobr></code>, or
<code><nobr>OUTS</nobr></code> instructions, but only supports the forms
such as <code><nobr>LODSB</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>MOVSW</nobr></code>,
and <code><nobr>SCASD</nobr></code>, which explicitly specify the size of
the components of the strings being manipulated.
<h4><a name="section-2.2.4">2.2.4 NASM Doesn't <code><nobr>ASSUME</nobr></code></a></h4>
<p>As part of NASM's drive for simplicity, it also does not support the
<code><nobr>ASSUME</nobr></code> directive. NASM will not keep track of
what values you choose to put in your segment registers, and will never
<em>automatically</em> generate a segment override prefix.
<h4><a name="section-2.2.5">2.2.5 NASM Doesn't Support Memory Models</a></h4>
<p>NASM also does not have any directives to support different 16-bit
memory models. The programmer has to keep track of which functions are
supposed to be called with a far call and which with a near call, and is
responsible for putting the correct form of <code><nobr>RET</nobr></code>
instruction (<code><nobr>RETN</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>RETF</nobr></code>; NASM accepts <code><nobr>RET</nobr></code>
itself as an alternate form for <code><nobr>RETN</nobr></code>); in
addition, the programmer is responsible for coding CALL FAR instructions
where necessary when calling <em>external</em> functions, and must also
keep track of which external variable definitions are far and which are
near.
<h4><a name="section-2.2.6">2.2.6 Floating-Point Differences</a></h4>
<p>NASM uses different names to refer to floating-point registers from
MASM: where MASM would call them <code><nobr>ST(0)</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>ST(1)</nobr></code> and so on, and
<code><nobr>a86</nobr></code> would call them simply
<code><nobr>0</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>1</nobr></code> and so on, NASM
chooses to call them <code><nobr>st0</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>st1</nobr></code> etc.
<p>As of version 0.96, NASM now treats the instructions with `nowait' forms
in the same way as MASM-compatible assemblers. The idiosyncratic treatment
employed by 0.95 and earlier was based on a misunderstanding by the
authors.
<h4><a name="section-2.2.7">2.2.7 Other Differences</a></h4>
<p>For historical reasons, NASM uses the keyword
<code><nobr>TWORD</nobr></code> where MASM and compatible assemblers use
<code><nobr>TBYTE</nobr></code>.
<p>NASM does not declare uninitialised storage in the same way as MASM:
where a MASM programmer might use
<code><nobr>stack db 64 dup (?)</nobr></code>, NASM requires
<code><nobr>stack resb 64</nobr></code>, intended to be read as `reserve 64
bytes'. For a limited amount of compatibility, since NASM treats
<code><nobr>?</nobr></code> as a valid character in symbol names, you can
code <code><nobr>? equ 0</nobr></code> and then writing
<code><nobr>dw ?</nobr></code> will at least do something vaguely useful.
<code><nobr>DUP</nobr></code> is still not a supported syntax, however.
<p>In addition to all of this, macros and directives work completely
differently to MASM. See <a href="nasmdoc4.htm">chapter 4</a> and
<a href="nasmdoc5.htm">chapter 5</a> for further details.
