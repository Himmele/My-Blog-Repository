      <P>
      <P>There are a few disadvantages, of course. The runtime =
performance costs=20
      of dynamic linking are substantial compared to those of static =
linking,=20
      since a large part of the linking process has to be redone every =
time a=20
      program runs. Every dynamically linked symbol used in a program =
has to be=20
      looked up in a symbol table and resolved. (Windows DLLs mitigate =
this cost=20
      somewhat, as we describe below.) Dynamic libraries are also larger =
than=20
      static libraries, since the dynamic ones have to include symbol =
tables.=20
      </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>
<P>Beyond issues of call compatibility, a chronic source of problems is =
changes=20
in library semantics. Since dynamic shared libraries are so easy to =
update=20
compared to unshared or static shared libraries, it's easy to change =
libraries=20
that are in use by existing programs, which means that the behavior of =
those=20
programs changes even though "nothing has changed". This is a frequent =
source of=20
problems on Microsoft Windows, where programs use a lot of shared =
libraries,=20
libraries go through a lot of versions, and library version control is =
not very=20
sophisticated. Most programs ship with copies of all of the libraries =
they use,=20
and installers often will inadvertently install an older version of a =
shared=20
library on top of a newer one, breaking programs that are expecting =
features=20
found in the newer one. Well-behaved applications pop up a warning =
before=20
installing an older library over a newer one, but even so, programs that =
depend=20
on semantics of older libraries have been known to break when newer =
versions=20
replace the older ones.=20
<P>
<H2>ELF dynamic linking</H2>Sun Microsystems' SunOS introduced dynamic =
shared=20
libraries to UNIX in the late 1980s. UNIX System V Release 4, which Sun=20
co-developed, introduced the ELF object format and adapted the Sun =
scheme to=20
ELF. ELF was clearly an improvement over the previous object formats, =
and by the=20
late 1990s it had become the standard for UNIX and UNIX like systems =
including=20
Linux and BSD derivatives.=20
<P>
<H2>Contents of an ELF file</H2>As mentioned in Chapter 3, an ELF file =
can be=20
viewed as a set of <I>sections</I>, interpreted by the linker, or a set =
of=20
<I>segments</I>, interpreted by the program loader. ELF programs and =
shared=20
libraries have the same general structure, but with different sets of =
segments=20
and sections.=20
<P>
<P>ELF shared libraries can be loaded at any address, so they invariably =
use=20
position independent code (PIC) so that the text pages of the file need =
not be=20
relocated and can be shared among multiple processes. As described in =
Chapter 8,=20
ELF linkers support PIC code with a Global Offset Table (GOT) in each =
shared=20
library that contains pointers to all of the static data referenced in =
the=20
program, Figure 1. The dynamic linker resolves and relocates all of the =
pointers=20
in the GOT. This can be a performance issue but in practice the GOT is =
small=20
except in very large libraries; a commonly used version of the standard =
C=20
library has only 180 entries in the GOT for over 350K of code.=20
<P>
<P>Since the GOT is in the same loadable ELF file as the code that =
references=20
it, and the relative addresses within a file don't change regardless of =
where=20
the program is loaded, the code can locate the GOT with a relative =
address, load=20
the address of the GOT into a register, and then load pointers from the =
GOT=20
whenever it needs to address static data. A library need not have a GOT =
if it=20
references no static data, but in practice all libraries do.=20
<P>
<P>To support dynamic linking, each ELF shared libary and each =
executable that=20
uses shared libraries has a Procedure Linkage Table (PLT). The PLT adds =
a level=20
of indirection for function calls analogous to that provided by the GOT =
for=20
data. The PLT also permits "lazy evaluation", that is, not resolving =
procedure=20
addresses until they're called for the first time. Since the PLT tends =
to have a=20
lot more entries than the GOT (over 600 in the C library mentioned =
above), and=20
most of the routines will never be called in any given program, that can =
both=20
speed startup and save considerable time overall.=20

<P>We discuss the details of the PLT below.=20
<P>
<P>An ELF dynamically linked file contains all of the linker information =
that=20
the runtime linker will need to relocate the file and resolve any =
undefined=20
symbols. The <TT>.dynsym</TT> section, the dynamic symbol table, =
contains all of=20
the file's imported and exported symbols. The <TT>.dynstr</TT> and=20
<TT>.hash</TT> sections contain the name strings for the symbol, and a =
hash=20
table the runtime linker can use to look up symbols quickly.=20
<P>
<P>The final extra piece of an ELF dynamically linked file is the=20
<TT>DYNAMIC</TT> segment (also marked as the <TT>.dynamic</TT> section) =
which=20
runtime dynamic linker uses to find the information about the file the =
linker=20
needs. It's loaded as part of the data segment, but is pointed to from =
the ELF=20
file header so the runtime dynamic linker can find it. The DYNAMIC =
section is a=20
list of tagged values and pointers. Some entry types occur just in =
programs,=20
some just in libraries, some in both.=20
<UL>
  <LI>NEEDED: the name of a library this file needs. (Always in =
programs,=20
  sometimes in libraries when one library is dependend on another, can =
occur=20
  more than once.)=20
  <LI>SONAME: "shared object name", the name of the file the linker =
uses.=20
  (Libraries.)=20
  <LI>SYMTAB, STRTAB, HASH, SYMENT, STRSZ,: point to the symbol table,=20
  associated string and hash tables, size of a symbol table entry, size =
of=20
  string table. (Both.)=20
  <LI>PLTGOT: points to the GOT, or on some architectures to the PLT =
(Both.)=20
  <LI>REL, RELSZ, and RELENT or RELA, RELASZ, and RELAENT: pointer to, =
number=20
  of, and size of relocation entries. REL entries don't contain addends, =
RELA=20
  entries do. (Both.)=20
  <LI>JMPREL, PLTRELSZ, and PLTREL: pointer to, size, and format (REL or =
RELA)=20
  of relocation table for data referred to by the PLT. (Both.)=20
  <LI>INIT and FINI: pointer to initializer and finalizer routines to be =
called=20
  at program startup and finish. (Optional but usual in both.)=20
  <LI>A few other obscure types not often used. </LI></UL>An entire ELF =
shared=20
library might look like Figure 2. First come the read-only parts, =
including the=20
symbol table, PLT, text, and read-only data, then the read-write parts =
including=20
regular data, GOT, and the dynamic section. The bss logically follows =
the last=20
read-write section, but as always isn't present in the file.=20

<P>An ELF program looks much the same, but in the read-only segment has =
init and=20
fini routines, and an INTERP section near the front of the file to =
specify the=20
name of the dynamic linker (usually <TT>ld.so</TT>). The data segment =
has no=20
GOT, since program files aren't relocated at runtime.=20
<P>
<H2>Loading a dynamically linked program</H2>Loading a dynamically =
linked ELF=20
program is a lengthy but straightforward process.=20
<P>
<H3>Starting the dynamic linker</H3>When the operating system runs the =
program,=20
it maps in the file's pages as normal, but notes that there's an =
INTERPRETER=20
section in the executable. The specified interpreter is the dynamic =
linker,=20
ld.so, which is itself in ELF shared library format. Rather than =
starting the=20
program, the system maps the dynamic linker into a convenient part of =
the=20
address space as well and starts ld.so, passing on the stack an =
<I>auxiliary=20
vector</I> of information needed by the linker. The vector includes:=20
<UL>
  <LI>AT_PHDR, AT_PHENT, and AT_PHNUM: The address of the program header =
for the=20
  program file, the size of each entry in the header, and the number of =
entries.=20
  This structure describes the segments in the loaded file. If the =
system hasn't=20
  mapped the program into memory, there may instead be a AT_EXECFD entry =
that=20
  contains the file descriptor on which the program file is open.=20
  <LI>AT_ENTRY: starting address of the program, to which the dynamic =
linker=20
  jumps after it has finished initialization.=20
  <LI>AT_BASE: The address at which the dynamic linker was loaded =
</LI></UL>
<P>
<P>At this point, bootstrap code at the beginning of ld.so finds its own =
GOT,=20
the first entry in which points to the DYNAMIC segment in the ld.so =
file. From=20
the dynamic segment, the linker can find its own relocation entries, =
relocate=20
pointers in its own data segment, and resolve code references to the =
routines=20
needed to load everything else. (The Linux ld.so names all of the =
essential=20
routines with names starting with <TT>_dt</TT>_ and special-case code =
looks for=20
symbols that start with the string and resolves them.)=20
<P>
<P>The linker then initializes a chain of symbol tables with pointers to =
the=20
program's symbol table and the linker's own symbol table. Conceptually, =
the=20
program file and all of the libraries loaded into a process share a =
single=20
symbol table. But rather than build a merged symbol table at runtime, =
the linker=20
keeps a linked list of the symbol tables in each file. each file =
contains a hash=20
table to speed symbol lookup, with a set of hash headers and a hash =
chain for=20
each header. The linker can search for a symbol quickly by computing the =

symbol's hash value once, then running through apprpriate hash chain in =
each of=20
the symbol tables in the list.=20
<P>
<H3>Finding the libraries</H3>Once the linker's own initializations are =
done, it=20
finds the names of the libraries required by the program. The program's =
program=20
header has a pointer to the "dynamic" segment in the file that contains =
dynamic=20
linking information. That segment contains a pointer, DT_STRTAB, to the =
file's=20
string table, and entries DT_NEEDED each of which contains the offset in =
the=20
string table of the name of a required library.=20
<P>
<P>For each library, the linker finds the library's ELF shared library =
file,=20
which is in itself a fairly complex process. The library name in a =
DT_NEEDED=20
entry is something like <I>libXt.so.6</I> (the Xt toolkit, version 6.) =
The=20
library file might in in any of several library directories, and might =
not even=20
have the same file name. On my system, the actual name of that library =
is=20
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXt.so.6.0, with the ``.0'' at the end being a minor =
version=20
number.=20
<P>
<P>The linker looks in these places to find the library:=20
<UL>
  <LI>If the dynamic segment contains an entry called DT_RPATH, it's a=20
  colon-separated list of directories to search for libraries. This =
entry is=20
  added by a command line switch or environment variable to the regular =
(not=20
  dynamic) linker at the time a program is linked. It's mostly used for=20
  subsystems like databases that load a collection of programs and =
supporting=20
  libraries into a single directory.=20
  <LI>If there's an environment symbol LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it's treated as =
a=20
  colon-separated list of directories in which the linker looks for the =
library.=20
  This lets a developer build a new version of a library, put it in the=20
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH and use it with existing linked programs either to =
test the=20
  new library, or equally well to instrument the behavior of the =
program. (It=20
  skips this step if the program is set-uid, for security reasons.)=20
  <LI>The linker looks in the library cache file =
<TT>/etc/ld.so.conf</TT> which=20
  contains a list of library names and paths. If the library name is =
present, it=20
  uses the corresponding path. This is the usual way that most libraries =
are=20
  found. (The file name at the end of the path need not be exactly the =
same as=20
  the library name, see the section on library versions, below.)=20
  <LI>If all else fails, it looks in the default directory /usr/lib, and =
if the=20
  library's still not found, displays an error message and exits. =
</LI></UL>
<P>
<P>Once it's found the file containing the library, the dynamic linker =
opens the=20
file, and reads the ELF header to find the program header which in turn =
points=20
to the file's segments including the dynamic segment. The linker =
allocates space=20
for the library's text and data segments and maps them in, along with =
zeroed=20
pages for the bss. From the library's dynamic segment, it adds the =
library's=20
symbol table to the chain of symbol tables, and if the library requires =
further=20
libraries not already loaded, adds any new libraries to the list to be =
loaded.=20
<P>
<P>When this process terminates, all of the libraries have been mapped =
in, and=20
the loader has a logical global symbol table consisting of the union of =
all of=20
the symbol tables of the program and the mapped library.=20
<P>
<H3>Shared library initialization</H3>Now the loader revisits each =
library and=20
handles the library's relocation entries, filling in the library's GOT =
and=20
performing any relocations needed in the library's data segment. =
Load-time=20
relocations on an x86 include:=20
<UL>
  <LI>R_386_GLOB_DAT, used to initialize a GOT entry to the address of a =
symbol=20
  defined in another library.=20
  <LI>R_386_32, a non-GOT reference to a symbol defined in another =
library,=20
  generally a pointer in static data.=20
  <LI>R_386_RELATIVE, for relocatable data references, typically a =
pointer to a=20
  string or other locally defined static data.=20
  <LI>R_386_JMP_SLOT, used to initialize GOT entries for the PLT, =
described=20
  later. </LI></UL>
<P>
<P>If a library has an <TT>.init</TT> section, the loader calls it to do =

library-specific initializations, such as C++ static constructors, and =
any=20
<TT>.fini</TT> section is noted to be run at exit time. (It doesn't do =
the init=20
for the main program, since that's handled in the program's own startup =
code.)=20
When this pass is done, all of the libraries are fully loaded and ready =
to=20
execute, and the loader calls the program's entry point to start the =
program.=20
<P>
<H2>Lazy procedure linkage with the PLT</H2>Programs that use shared =
libraries=20
generally contain calls to a lot of functions. In a single run of the =
program=20
many of the functions are never called, in error routines or other parts =
of the=20
program that aren't used. Furthermore, each shared library also contains =
calls=20
to functions in other libraries, even fewer of which will be executed in =
a given=20
program run since many of them are in routines that the program never =
calls=20
either directly or indirectly.=20
<P>
<P>To speed program startup, dynamically linked ELF programs use lazy =
binding of=20
procedure addresses. That is, the address of a procedure isn't bound =
until the=20
first time the procedure is called.=20
<P>
<P>ELF supports lazy binding via the Procedure Linkage Table, or PLT. =
Each=20
dynamically bound program and shared library has a PLT, with the PLT =
containing=20
an entry for each non-local routine called from the program or library, =
Figure=20
3. Note that the PLT in PIC code is itself PIC, so it can be part of the =

read-only text segment.=20

<P>All calls within the program or library to a particular routine are =
adjusted=20
when the program or library is built to be calls to the routine's entry =
in the=20
PLT. The first time the program or library calls a routine, the PLT =
entry calls=20
the runtime linker to resolve the actual address of the routine. After =
that, the=20
PLT entry jumps directly to the actual address, so after the first call, =
the=20
cost of using the PLT is a single extra indirect jump at a procedure =
call, and=20
nothing at a return.=20
<P>
<P>The first entry in the PLT, which we call PLT0, is special code to =
call the=20
dynamic linker. At load time, the dynamic linker automatically places =
two values=20
in the GOT. At GOT+4 (the second word of the GOT) it puts a code that =
identifies=20
the particular library. At GOT+8, it puts the address of the dynamic =
linker's=20
symbol resolution routine.=20
<P>
<P>The rest of the entries in the PLT, which we call PLTn, each start =
with an=20
indirect jump through a GOT entry. Each PLT entry has a corresponding =
GOT entry=20
which is initially set to point to the push instruction in the PLT entry =
that=20
follows the jmp. (In a PIC file this requires a loadtime relocation, but =
not an=20
expensive symbol lookup.) Following the jump is a push instruction which =
pushes=20
a relocation offset, the offset in the file's relocation table of a =
special=20
relocation entry of type <TT>R_386_JMP_SLOT</TT>. The relocation entry's =
symbol=20
reference points to the symbol in the file's symbol table, and its =
address=20
points to the GOT entry.=20
<P>
<P>This compact but rather baroque arragement means that the first time =
the=20
program or library calls a PLT entry, the first jump in the PLT entry in =
effect=20
does nothing, since the GOT entry through which it jumps points back =
into the=20
PLT entry. Then the push instruction pushes the offset value which =
indirectly=20
identifies both the symbol to resolve and the GOT entry into which to =
resolve=20
it, and jumps to PLT0. The instructions in PLT0 push another code that=20
identifies which program or library it is, and then jumps into stub code =
in the=20
dynamic linker with the two identifying codes at the top of the stack. =
Note that=20
this was a jump, rather than a call, above the two identifying words =
just pushed=20
is the return address back to the routine that called into the PLT.=20
<P>
<P>Now the stub code saves all the registers and calls an internal =
routine in=20
the dynamic linker to do the resolution. the two identifying words =
suffice to=20
find the library's symbol table and the routine's entry in that symbol =
table.=20
The dynamic linker looks up the symbol value using the concatenated =
runtime=20
symbol table, and stores the routine's address into the GOT entry. Then =
the stub=20
code restores the registers, pops the two words that the PLT pushed, and =
jumps=20
off to the routine. The GOT entry having been updated, subsequent calls =
to that=20
PLT entry jump directly to the routine itself without entering the =
dynamic=20
linker.=20
<P>
<H2>Other peculiarities of dynamic linking</H2>The ELF linker and =
dynamic linker=20
have a lot of obscure code to handle special cases and try and keep the =
runtime=20
semantics as similar as possible to whose of unshared libraries.=20
<P>
<H3>Static initializations</H3>If a program has an external reference to =
a=20
global variable defined in a shared library, the linker has to create in =
the=20
program a copy of the variable, since program data addresses have to be =
bound at=20
link time, Figure 4. This poses no problem for the code in the shared =
library,=20
since the code can refer to the variable via a GOT pointer which the =
dynamic=20
linker can fix up, but there is a problem if the library initializes the =

variable. To deal with this problem, the linker puts an entry in the =
program's=20
relocation table (which otherwise just contains <TT>R_386_JMP_SLOT</TT>, =

<TT>R_386_GLOB_DAT</TT>, <TT>R_386_32</TT>, and <TT>R_386_RELATIVE</TT> =
entries)=20
of type <TT>R_386_COPY</TT> that points to the place in the program =
where the=20
copy of the variable is defined, and tells the dynamic linker to copy =
the=20
initial value of that word of data from the shared library.=20

<P>Although this feature is essential for certain kinds of code, it =
occurs very=20
rarely in practice. This is a band-aid, since it only works for single =
word=20
data. The initializers that do occur are always pointers to procedures =
or other=20
data, so the band-aid suffices.=20
<P>
<H3>Library versions</H3>Dynamic libraries are generally named with =
major and=20
minor versions numbers, like <TT>libc.so.1.1</TT> but programs should be =
bound=20
only to major version numbers like <TT>libc.so.1</TT> since minor =
versions are=20
supposed to be upward compatible.=20
<P>
<P>To keep program loading reasonably fast, the system manager maintains =
a cache=20
file containing the full pathname most recent version of each library, =
which is=20
updated by a configuration program whenever a new library is installed.=20
<P>
<P>To support this design, each dynamically linked library can have a =
"true=20
name" called the <I>SONAME</I> assigned at library creation time. For =
example,=20
the library called <TT>libc.so.1.1</TT> would have a SONAME of=20
<TT>libc.so.1</TT>. (The SONAME defaults to the library's name.) When =
the linker=20
builds a program that uses shared libraries, it lists the SONAMEs of the =

libraries it used rather than the actual names of the libraries. The =
cache=20
creation program scans all of the directories that contain shared =
libraries,=20
finds all of the shared libraries, extracts the SONAME from each one, =
and where=20
there are multiple libraries with the same SONAME, discards all but the =
highest=20
version number. Then it writes the cache file with SONAMEs and full =
pathnames so=20
at runtime the dynamic linker can quickly find the current version of =
each=20
library.=20
<P>
<H2>Dynamic loading at runtime</H2>Although the ELF dynamic linker is =
usually=20
called implcitly at program load time and from PLT entries, programs can =
also=20
call it explicitly using <TT>dlopen()</TT> to load a shared library and=20
<TT>dlsym()</TT> to find the address of a symbol, usually a procedure to =
call.=20
Those two routines are actually simple wrappers that call back into the =
dynamic=20
linker. When the dynamic linker loads a library via <TT>dlopen()</TT>, =
it does=20
the same relocation and symbol resolution it does on any other library, =
so the=20
dynamically loaded program can without any special arrangements call =
back to=20
routines already loaded and refer to global data in the running program. =

<P>
<P>This permits users to add extra functionality to programs without =
access to=20
the source code of the programs and without even having to stop and =
restart the=20
programs (useful when the program is something like a database or a web =
server.)=20
Mainframe operating systems have provided access to "exit routines" like =
this=20
since at least the early 1960s, albeit without such a convenient =
interface, and=20
it's long been a way to add great flexibility to packaged applications. =
It also=20
provides a way for programs to extend themselves; there's no reason a =
program=20
couldn't write a routine in C or C++, run the compiler and linker to =
create a=20
shared library, then dynamically load and run the new code. (Mainframe =
sort=20
programs have linked and loaded custom inner loop code for each sort job =
for=20
decades.)=20
<P>
<H2>Microsoft Dynamic Link Libraries</H2>Microsoft Windows also provides =
shared=20
libraries, called dynamic-link libraries or DLLs in a fashion similar to =
but=20
somewhat simpler than ELF shared libraries. The design of DLLs changed=20
substantially between the 16 bit Windows 3.1 and the 32 bit Windows NT =
and 95.=20
This discussion addresses only the more modern Win32 libraries. DLLs =
import=20
procedure addresses using a PLT-like scheme. Although the design of DLLs =
would=20
make it possible to import data addresses using a GOT-like scheme, in =
practice=20
they use a simpler scheme that requires explicit program code to =
dereference=20
imported pointers to shared data.=20
<P>
<P>In Windows, both programs and DLLs are PE format (portable =
executable) files=20
are intended to be memory mapped into a process. Unlike Windows 3.1, =
where all=20
applications shared a single address space, Win32 gives each application =
its own=20
address space and executables and libraries are mapped into each address =
space=20
where they are used. For read-only code this doesn't make any practical=20
difference, but for data it means that each application using a DLL gets =
its own=20
copy of the DLL's data. (That's a slight oversimplification, since PE =
files can=20
mark some sections as shared data with a single copy shared among all=20
applications that use the file, but most data is unshared.)=20
<P>
<P>Loading a Windows executable and DLLs is similar to loading a =
dynamically=20
linked ELF program, although in the Windows case the dynamic linker is =
part of=20
the kernel. First the kernel maps in the executable file, guided by =
section info=20
in the PE headers. Then it maps in all of the DLLs that the executable =
refers=20
to, again guided by the PE headers in each DLL.=20
<P>
<P>PE files can contain relocation entries. An executable generally =
won't=20
contain them and so has to be mapped at the address for which it was =
linked.=20
DLLs all do contain relocation entries, and are relocated when they're =
mapped in=20
if the address space for which they were linked isn't available. =
(Microsoft=20
calls runtime relocation <I>rebasing</I>.)=20
<P>
<P>All PE files, both executables and DLLs, have an entry point, and the =
loader=20
calls a DLL's entry point when the DLL is loaded, when the DLL is =
unloaded, and=20
each time a process thread attaches to or detaches from the DLL. (The =
loader=20
passes an argument to say why it's making each call.) This provides a =
hook for=20
static initializers and destructors analogous to the ELF <TT>.init</TT> =
and=20
<TT>.fini</TT> sections.=20
<P>
<H3>Imported and exported symbols in PE files</H3>PE supports shared =
libraries=20
with two special sections of the file, <TT>.edata</TT>, for exported =
data, that=20
lists the symbols exported from a file, and <TT>.idata</TT>, that lists =
the=20
symbols imported into a file. Program files generally have only an=20
<TT>.idata</TT> section, while DLLs always have an <TT>.edata</TT> and =
may have=20
a <TT>.idata</TT> if they use other DLLs. Symbols can be exported either =
by=20
symbol name, or by "ordinal", a small integer that gives the index of =
the symbol=20
in the export address table. Linking by ordinals is slightly more =
efficient=20
since it avoids a symbol lookup, but considerably more error prone since =
it's up=20
to the person who builds a DLL to ensure that ordinals stay the same =
from one=20
library version to another. In practice ordinals are usually used to =
call system=20
services that rarely change, and names for everything else.=20
<P>
<P>The <TT>.edata</TT> section contains an export directory table that =
describes=20

symbols, Figure 5.=20

<P>The export address table contains the RVA (relative virtual address, =

is a string naming the symbol to use to satisfy the reference, probably =

in a different DLL. The ordinal and name pointer tables are parallel, =
with each=20
entry in the name pointer table being the RVA of the name string for the =
symbol,=20
and the ordinal being the index in the export address table. (Ordinals =

<P>For each imported DLL, there is an array of import addresses, =
typically in=20
the program's text segment, into which the program loader places the =
resolved=20
addresses. The import lookup table identifies the symbols to import, =
with the=20
entries in the import lookup table being parallel to those in the import =
address=20
table. The lookup table consists of 32 bit entries. If the high bit of =
an entry=20
is set, the low 31 bits are the ordinal of the symbol to import, =
otherwise the=20
entry is the RVA of an entry in the hint/name table. Each hint/name =
entry=20
consists of a four-byte hint that guesses the index of the symbol in the =
DLL's=20
export name pointer table, followed by the null terminated symbol name. =
The=20
program loader uses the hint to probe the export table, and if the =
symbol name=20
matches, it uses that symbol, otherwise it binary searches the entire =
export=20
table for the name. (If the DLL hasn't changed, or at least its list of =
exported=20
symbols hasn't changed, since the program that uses the DLL was linked, =
the=20
guess will be right.)=20
<P>
<P>Unlike ELF imported symbols, the values of symbols imported via=20
<TT>.idata</TT> are only placed in the import address table, not fixed =
up=20
anywhere else in the importing file. For code addresses, this makes =
little=20
difference. When the linker builds an executable or DLL, it creates in =
the text=20
section a table of misnamed "thunks", indirect jumps through the entries =
in the=20
import address table, and uses the addresses of the thunks as the =
address of the=20
imported routine, which is transparent to the programmer. (The thunks as =
well as=20
most of the data in the <TT>.idata</TT> section actually come from a =
stub=20
library created at the same time as the DLL.) In recent versions of =
Microsoft's=20
C and C++ compiler, if the programmer knows that a routine will be =
called in a=20
DLL, the routine can be declared "dllimport", and the compiler will emit =
an=20
indirect call to the address table entry, avoiding the extra indirect =
jump. For=20
data addresses, the situation is more problematical, since it's harder =
to hide=20
the extra level of indirection required to address a symbol in another=20
executable. Traditionally, programmers just bit the bullet and =
explicitly=20
declared imported variables to be pointers to the real values and =
explicitly=20
dereferencd the pointers. Recent versions of Microsoft's C and C++ =
compiler also=20
let the programmer declare global data to be "dllimport" and the =
compiler will=20
emit the extra pointer deferences, much like ELF code that references =
data=20
indirectly via pointers in the GOT.=20
<P>
<H3>Lazy binding</H3>Recent versions of Windows compilers have added =
delay=20
loaded imports to permit lazy symbol binding for procedures, somewhat =
like the=20
ELF PLT. A delay-loaded DLL has a structure similar to the =
<TT>.idata</TT>=20
import directory table, but not in the <I>.idata</I> section so the =
program=20
loader doesn't handle it automatically. The entries in the import =
address table=20
initially all point to a helper routine that finds and loads the DLL and =

replaces the contents of the address table with the actual addresses. =
The=20
delay-loaded directory table has a place to store the original contents =
of the=20
import address table so the values can be put back if the DLL is later =
unloaded.=20
Microsoft provides a standard helper routine, but its interfaces are =
documented=20
and programmers can write their own versions if need be.=20
<P>
<P>Windows also permits programs to load and unload DLLs explicitly =
using=20
<TT>LoadLibrary</TT> and <TT>FreeLibrary</TT>, and to find addresses of =
symbols=20
using <TT>GetProcAddress</TT>.=20
<P>
<H3>DLLs and threads</H3>One area in which the Windows DLL model doesn't =
work=20
particularly well is thread local storage. A Windows program can start =
multiple=20
threads in the same process, which share the process' address space. =
Each thread=20
has a small chunk of thread local storage (TLS) to keep data specific to =
that=20
thread, such as pointers to data structures and resources that the thead =
is=20
using. The TLS needs "slots" for the data from the executable and from =
each DLL=20
that uses TLS. The Windows linker can create a .tls section in a PE =
executable,=20
that defines the layout for the TLS needed by routines in the executable =
and any=20
DLLs to which it directly refers. Each time the process creates a =
thread, the=20
new thread gets its own TLS, created using the .tls section as a =
template.=20
<P>
<P>The problem is that most DLLs can either be linked implicitly from =
the=20
executable, or loaded explicitly with <TT>LoadLibrary</TT>. DLLs loaded=20
explicitly don't automatically get .tls storage, and since a DLL's =
author can't=20
predict whether a library will be invoked implicitly or explicitly, it =
can't=20
depend on the .tls section.=20
<P>
<P>Windows defines runtime system calls that allocate slots at the end =
of the=20
TLS. DLLs use those calls rather than .tls unless the DLL is known only =
to be=20
invoked implicitly.=20
<H2>OSF/1 pseudo-static shared libraries</H2>OSF/1, the ill-fated UNIX =
variant=20
from the Open Software Foundation, used a shared library scheme =
intermediate=20
between static and dynamic linking. Its authors noted that static =
linking is a=20
lot faster than dynamic since less relocation is needed, and that =
libraries are=20
updated infrequently enough that system managers are willing to endure =
some pain=20
when they update shared libraries, although not the agony of relinking =
every=20
executable program in the entire system.=20
<P>
<P>So OSF/1 took the approach of maintaining a global symbol table =
visible to=20
all processes, and loaded all the shared libraries into a sharable =
address space=20
at system boot time. This assigned all of the libraries addresses that =
wouldn't=20
change while the system was running. Each time a program started, if it =
used=20
shared libraries, it would map in the shared libraries and symbol table =
and=20
resolve undefined references in the executable using the global symbol =
table. No=20
load-time relocation was ever required since programs were all linked to =
load in=20
a part of the address space that was guaranteed to be available in each =
process,=20
and the library relocation had already happened when they were loaded at =
boot=20
time.=20
<P>
<P>When one of the shared libraries changed, the system just had to be =
rebooted=20
normally, at which point the system loaded the new libraries and created =
a new=20
symbol table for executables to use.=20
<P>
<P>This scheme was clever, but it wasn't very satisfactory. For one =
thing,=20
processing symbol lookups is considerably slower than processing =
relocation=20
entries, so avoiding relocation wasn't that much of a performance =
advantage. For=20
another, dynamic linking provides the ability to load and run a library =
at=20
runtime, and the OSF/1 scheme didn't provide for that.=20

address spaces,=20
it's usually possible to choose an address range for a shared library =
that's=20
available in all or at least most of the processes that use the library. =
One=20
very effective technique is similar to the Windows approach. Either when =
the=20
library is linked or the first time a library is loaded, tentatively =
bind its=20
addresses to a chunk of address space. After that, each time a program =
links to=20
the library, use the same addresses of possible, which means that no =
relocation=20
will be necessary. If that address space isn't available in a new =
process, the=20
library is relocated as before.=20
<P>
<P>SGI systems use the term <I>QUICKSTART</I> to describe the process of =

pre-relocating objects at linktime, or in a separate pass over the =
shared=20
library. BeOS caches the relocated library the first time it's loaded =
into a=20
process. If multiple libraries depend on each other, in principle it =
should be=20
possible to pre-relocate and then pre-resolve symbol references among =
libraries,=20
although I'm not aware of any linkers that do so.=20
<P>
<P>If a system uses pre-relocated libraries, PIC becomes a lot less =
important.=20
All the processes that load a library at its pre-relocated address can =
share the=20
library's code whether it's PIC or not, so a non-PIC library at a =
well-chosen=20
address can in practice be as sharable as PIC without the performance =
loss of=20
PIC. This is basically the static linked library approach from Chapter =
9, except=20
that in case of address space collisions, rather than the program =
failing the=20
dynamic linker moves the libraries at some loss of performance. Windows =
uses=20
this approach.=20
<P>
<P>BeOS implements cached relocated libraries with great thoroughness, =
including=20
preserving correct semantics when libaries change. When a new version of =
a=20
library is installed BeOS notes the fact and creates a new cached =
version rather=20
than using the old cached version when programs refer to the library. =
Library=20
changes can have a ripple effect. When library A refers to symbols in =
library B=20
and B is updated, a new cached version of A will also have to be created =
if any=20
of the referenced symbols in B have moved. This does make the =
programmer's life=20
easier, but it's not clear to me that libraries are in practice updated =
often=20
enough to merit the considerable amount of system code needed to track =
library=20
updates.=20
<P>
<H2>Comparison of dynamic linking approaches</H2>The Unix/ELF and =
Windows/PE=20
dynamic linking differ in several interesting ways.=20
<P>
<P>The ELF scheme uses a single name space per program, while the PE =
scheme uses=20
a name space per library. An ELF executable lists the symbols it needs =
and the=20
libraries it needs, but it doesn't record which symbol is in which =
library. A PE=20
file, on the other hand, lists the symbols to import from each library. =
The PE=20
scheme is less flexible but also more resistant to inadvertent spoofing. =
Imagine=20
that an executable calls routine AFUNC which is found in library A and =
BFUNC=20
which is found in library B. If a new version of library A happens to =
define its=20
own BFUNC, an ELF program could use the new BFUNC in preference to the =
old one,=20
while a PE program wouldn't. This is a problem with some large =
libraries; one=20
partial solution is to use the poorly documented DT_FILTER and =
DT_AUXILIARY=20
fields to tell the dynamic linker what libraries this one imports =
symbols from,=20
so the linker will search those libraries for imported symbols before =
searching=20
the executable and the rest of the libraries. The DT_SYMBOLIC field =
tells the=20
dynamic linker to search the library's own symbol table first, so that =
other=20
libraries cannot shadow intra-library references. (This isn't always =
desirable;=20
consider the malloc hack described in the previous chapter.) These =
ad-hoc=20
approaches make it less likely that symbols in unrelated libraries will=20
inadvertently shadow the correct symbols, but they're no substitude for =
a=20
hierarchical link-time name space as we'll see in Chapter 11 that Java =
has.=20
<P>
<P>The ELF scheme tries considerably harder than the PE scheme to =
maintain the=20
semantics of static linked programs. In an ELF program, references to =
data=20
imported from another library are automatically resolved, while a PE =
program=20
needs to treat imported data specially. The PE scheme has trouble =
comparing the=20
values of pointers to functions, since the address of an imported =
function is=20
the address of the "thunk" that calls it, not the address of the actual =
function=20
in the other library. ELF handles all pointers the same.=20
<P>
<P>At run-time, nearly all of the Windows dynamic linker is in the =
operating=20
system, while the ELF dynamic linker runs entirely as part of the =
application,=20
with the kernel merely mapping in the initial files. The Windows scheme =
is=20
arguably faster, since it doesn't have to map and relocate the dynamic =
linker in=20
each process before it starts linking. The ELF scheme is definitely a =
lot more=20
flexible. Since each executable names the "interpreter" program (now =
always the=20
dynamic linker named ld.so) to use, different executables could use =
different=20
interpreters without requring any operating system changes. In practice, =
this=20
makes it easier to support executables from variant versions of Unix, =
notably=20
Linux and BSD, by making a dynamic linker that links to compatibility =
libraries=20
that support non-native executables.=20
<P>
<H2>Exercises</H2>In ELF shared libraries, libraries are often linked so =
that=20
calls from one routine to another within a single shared library go =

<P>
<P>Imagine that a program calls a library routine <TT>plugh()</TT> that =

in a shared library, and the programmer builds a dynamically linked =

silly name for a routine and installs a new version of the library that =

set?=20
<P>

our project linker, since much of the work of dynamic linking happens at =

runtime, not link time. Much of the work of building a shared library =
was=20
already done in the project 8-3 that created PIC executables. A =
dynamically=20
linked shared library is just a PIC executable with a well-defined list =
of=20
imported and exported symbols and a list of other libraries on which it =
depends.=20
To mark the file as a shared library or an executable that uses shared=20
libraries, the first line is:=20
<P><TT><BR>LINKLIB lib1 lib2 ... <BR>or <BR>LINK lib1 lib2 ...=20
<P></TT>
<P><BR>where the lib's are the names of other shared libraries on which =
this one=20
depends.=20
<P>
<P><I>Project 10-1:</I> Starting with the version of the linker from =
project=20
8-3, extend the linker to produce shared libraries and executables that =
need=20
shared libraries. The linker needs to take as its input a list of input =
files to=20
combine into the output executable or library, as well as other shared =
libraries=20
to search. The output file contains a symbol table with defined =
(exported) and=20
undefined (imported) symbols. Relocation types are the ones for PIC =
files along=20
with AS4 and RS4 for references to imported symbols.=20
<P>
<P><I>Project 10-2:</I> Write a run-time binder, that is, a program that =
takes=20
an executable that uses shared libraries and resolves its references. It =
should=20
read in the executable, then read in the necessary libraries, relocating =
them to=20
non-overlapping available addresses, and creating a logically merged =
symbol=20
table. (You may want to actually create such a table, or use a list of =
per-file=20
tables as ELF does.) Then resolve all of the relocations and external=20
references. When you're done, all code and data should be assigned =
memory=20
addresses, and all addresses in the code and data should be resolved and =

relocated to the assigned addresses. </P></BODY></HTML>
